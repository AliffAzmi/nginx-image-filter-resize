# nginx-image-filter-resize
It's a nginx image resizer to be specify. We use in our Back-end CMS.

## How to load Module
```
Tutorial [here](https://zaiste.net/nginx_image_server_with_image_filter_secure_link_modules/).
```

## Technology used
```
Nginx
Module - ngx_http_image_filter_module
Terminal
```

## Sample Configuration 
```
location /img/ {
    proxy_pass   http://backend;
    image_filter resize 150 100;
    image_filter rotate 90;
    error_page   415 = /empty;
}

location = /empty {
    empty_gif;
}
```

## Directives
```
Syntax:	image_filter **off**;
image_filter **test**;
image_filter **size**;
image_filter **rotate 90 | 180 | 270**;
image_filter **resize width height**;
image_filter **crop width height**;
Default:	
image_filter off;
Context:	location
```

Sets the type of transformation to perform on images:

**off**

turns off module processing in a surrounding location.

**test**

ensures that responses are images in either JPEG, GIF, PNG, or WebP format. Otherwise, the 415 (Unsupported Media Type) error is returned.

**size**

outputs information about images in a JSON format, e.g.:
> { "img" : { "width": 100, "height": 100, "type": "gif" } }

In case of an error, the output is as follows:
> {}

**rotate 90|180|270**

rotates images counter-clockwise by the specified number of degrees. Parameter value can contain variables. This mode can be used either alone or along with the resize and crop transformations.

**resize width height**

proportionally reduces an image to the specified sizes. To reduce by only one dimension, another dimension can be specified as “-”. In case of an error, the server will return code 415 (Unsupported Media Type). Parameter values can contain variables. When used along with the rotate parameter, the rotation happens after reduction.

**crop width height**

proportionally reduces an image to the larger side size and crops extraneous edges by another side. To reduce by only one dimension, another dimension can be specified as “-”. In case of an error, the server will return code 415 (Unsupported Media Type). Parameter values can contain variables. When used along with the rotate parameter, the rotation happens before reduction.
